How to use:

Length(): just call the function without any argument.

add(i,x): put i as the index on which u want to add element 'x'.

remove(i):put i as the index whose element  u want to  remove.

resize(): you don't need to call this function by yourself, it'll run automatically if needed in add() & remove().

Print(): It will just print your array wothout any argument.

Sort(): It will sort your array , you don't need any argument to put.
